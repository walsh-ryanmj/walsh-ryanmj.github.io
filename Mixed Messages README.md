Mixed Messages README

This was part of an off-platform project with the Codecademy curriculum (try saying that 5 times fast). 

The project objectives were:
- Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line interface
- Develop it all locally on your computer


I accomplished these relatively easy tasks using a few random facts from an app on my phone as the content. 

I'm on a learning curve for the Git version control and command line, but getting more comfortable the more I use them. I imagine the commits I log in the future will have more work and be more relevant (though I am an over-saver so it's a matter of when committing changes makes sense).
